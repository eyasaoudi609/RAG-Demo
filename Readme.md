# Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the langchain and chromadb libraries for creating a question answering system based on descriptions extracted from a JSON file. The system leverages pre-trained language models (LLMs) and vector stores to generate embeddings and retrieve relevant information for answering questions.
